This visual displays the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the analyzed job market.
The market has a total of 140,268 Applicants competing for 9,261 Jobs.
This results in a high competition ratio, quantified as 15.15 Applicants per Job. This metric is crucial for understanding the market's competitiveness, indicating that for every single job opening, there are over fifteen individuals vying for the position

  The ‚ÄúTrends in Job Openings and Applications‚Äù chart presents how job dynamics have evolved between 2017 and 2022. Job postings and applications remained relatively stable until 2019 but spiked sharply around 2020 ‚Äî a shift likely tied to the pandemic, which disrupted industries and changed how people searched for jobs. The following years show fluctuating patterns, suggesting a market in transition ‚Äî adjusting to remote work, new hiring models, and changing economic conditions.

The Job Postings by Experience chart clearly illustrates a demand curve that resembles a bell shape. Job volume shows a steady increase, climbing from 589 postings at 1 year of experience. Demand hits its maximum at the 4-year mark, with an outstanding 1816 job postings. This peak signifies that the vast majority of opportunities target professionals with moderate experience. Beyond this point, the number of jobs begins a consistent decline.
Postings drop below 1,000 at 7 years and continue to fall. The market shows significantly less demand for highly experienced candidates, with opportunities for 10 to 12 years of experience dwindling to below 100. In summary, the job market strongly favors the mid-level professional segment (3-6 years).


<img width="405" height="259" alt="Job vs Experience - Job market" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/183f3dfe-c45e-4397-b375-a0b982df07c4" />


The ‚ÄúJob Type vs. Experience,‚Äù reinforces this understanding by showing the average experience required at each job level. The progression is smooth ‚Äî internships typically need under a year of experience, while entry-level roles average around 1.6 years. As we move toward associate and mid-senior levels, the required experience grows to around 4‚Äì5 years, eventually reaching nearly 9 years for directors and over 14 years for executives. This consistent rise reflects a well-defined career growth structure where responsibilities and skill expectations increase gradually with experience.

<img width="851" height="247" alt="Gap" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c476fe5-c06b-4a83-b743-f4f2021c9b8a" />

The above, ‚ÄúRelative Gap by Job Position Levels,‚Äù reveals a clear imbalance between job openings and the number of applicants. Entry-level and internship roles face the largest relative gaps, showing that while these positions attract thousands of applicants, the number of available jobs remains limited. On the other hand, executive and director-level positions have significantly smaller gaps, suggesting that these senior roles are less saturated and demand more specialized experience. This pattern highlights how the job market is crowded at the beginning of career paths, while higher-level positions struggle with talent shortages.


<img width="380" height="312" alt="Salaries by title" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a81ff55-2632-4052-8169-6ded07a570b8" />

This line chart, titled "Salary Trends by Title," compares the average annual pay for four roles: Business Analyst (BA), Data Analyst (DA), Data Engineer (DE), and Data Scientist (DS), across years of experience. The data clearly shows that Data Engineer (DE) and Data Scientist (DS) roles consistently command the highest salaries, generally fluctuating between $120,000 and $250,000. These two high-demand titles exhibit significant salary volatility, with the Data Engineer salary seeing a dramatic spike near the 9-year experience mark.
In contrast, Business Analyst (BA) and Data Analyst (DA) salaries remain relatively stable and clustered together at the lower end of the spectrum, mostly ranging from $70,000 to $110,000. These roles show less variation with increasing experience compared to the engineering and science roles. Overall, the data suggests a substantial premium is placed on Data Engineering and Data Science expertise throughout a professional's career, while the analytical and business-focused roles maintain a more consistent, lower pay scale.

Key Findings - Analysis Answers: 

A. Market Dynamics & Competition

The overall job market shows high competition, with 140,268 applicants competing for 9,261 job openings, resulting in an average of 15.15 applicants per job.

Internship and Entry-level positions face the highest competitive pressure, with relative gap scores of 19.78 and 17.80, respectively.

In contrast, Executive and Director roles have much smaller gaps, reflecting lower applicant density but higher skill requirements, signaling a shortage of qualified senior professionals.

B. Experience & Demand Alignment

The optimal experience range to target the highest job demand lies between 3 to 6 years, where job postings peak ‚Äî specifically reaching 1,816 openings at 4 years of experience.

Experience requirements scale consistently across the career ladder:

Internship: ~0.3 years

Entry-level: ~1.6 years

Associate: ~3.7 years

Mid-Senior: ~5.4 years

Director: ~9 years

Executive: ~14 years

This steady progression indicates a structured career path, where experience directly correlates with role complexity and responsibility.

C. Salary Trends & Value

Among the four data roles, Data Engineer (DE) and Data Scientist (DS) show the highest salary volatility and peak earning potential, with salaries ranging between $120,000 and $250,000.

Business Analyst (BA) and Data Analyst (DA) roles maintain stable, moderate pay scales, typically between $70,000 and $110,000.

These trends highlight a strong market premium for technical and infrastructure-focused roles, while analytical and business-oriented positions show steady but lower pay growth.
 
D. Historical Volatility

Between 2017 and 2019, both job postings and applications remained relatively stable.

A sharp surge in 2020 marked a period of market expansion - likely driven by pandemic-related digital transformation and remote work trends.

From 2021 to 2022, both postings and applications fluctuated, reflecting adjustments to new hiring models, remote job structures, and post-pandemic recovery in the labor market.
